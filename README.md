### git_workshop

This folder contains some script files created by different people in order to learn how to make commits and push them to the repository.

### rmarkdown_workshop

This folder contains the favourite plots of people. The plots were used to create different RMarkdown documents during the workshop.

### S4_R

This folder contains the basics to use S4 class objects in R. It contains the code with a small presentation (in .Rmd).

### ggplot_advanced_plotting_part1 ###

This folder contains the `.rmd` files that generates an `html` report (also in the folder) with examples and instructions on how to generate two more advanced plots with `ggplot2`. This involves ploting sequence motifs and inserting images, also combining plots.
